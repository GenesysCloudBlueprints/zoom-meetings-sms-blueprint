This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint explains how to set up Genesys Cloud and Zoom so that agents can schedule a Zoom meeting while they are interacting with customers as part of an inbound or outbound call. When an agent escalates to Zoom, Genesys Cloud automatically sends an SMS message with the meeting URL to the customer and also opens the Zoom meeting for the agent. The call must be in a queue in order for this solution to work.

The following illustration shows the meeting scheduling solution from an agentâ€™s point of view.

The following video shows the end-to-end customer and agent experience that this blueprint solution enables.

![Overview](images/ZoomVideoSMSBlueprint.gif "Overview")

To enable an agent to create a Zoom meeting from their Genesys Cloud agent UI, you use several public APIs that are available from Genesys Cloud and Zoom. The following illustration shows the API calls between Genesys Cloud and Zoom.

![Zoom integration](images/zoom-architect.png "The API calls between Genesys Cloud and Zoom API")

## Solution components

* **Genesys Cloud CX** - A suite of Genesys cloud services for enterprise-grade communications, collaboration, and contact center management. Contact center agents use the Genesys Cloud user interface.
* **Genesys Cloud API** - A set of RESTful APIs that enables you to extend and customize your Genesys Cloud environment. The Genesys Cloud API for agentless SMS notification sends the meeting information to the caller.
* **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** - A cloud computing platform that provides a variety of cloud services such as computing power, database storage, and content delivery. AWS hosts Genesys Cloud.
* **Zoom** - A virtual meeting and collaboration app. Zoom is the app that hosts the meeting for our solution.
