#  Set up Zoom meeting on Genesys Cloud blueprint

This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint explains how to set up Genesys Cloud and Zoom so that agents can schedule a Zoom meeting while interacting with customers as part of an inbound or outbound call. When an agent escalates to Zoom, Genesys Cloud sends an SMS message to the customer with a meeting URL and opens Zoom for the agent. The call must be in a queue in order for this solution to work.
